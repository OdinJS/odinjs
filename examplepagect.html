				<p class="body"> Programming is one of the few technological things you can learn that are the most popular, 
				aside from Networking related jobs/classes in school.
				With programming, you can create the most simplistic code, this being "Hello World" where in almost any coding language, 
				it teaches you the very basics and what the language is capable of.

				<p class="body"> Every programming language has Pros & Cons. They all have pros that might be cons in another languages, 
				so technically there is "no perfect" coding language. Some programmers have preferences like C++, or C#. Some others prefer Python and Java.
				It is mainly all personal preference which coding langauge you start to learn first, but from these articles, it shows that Python is the easiest
				to learn due to the syntax being the most simple. It does state, that one con is that if one small thing is off, everything breaks and you would
				need to find the error. Another erorr is that slow, compared to other languages such as C++/C# or Java.

				These examples are not only the projects you could, there are hundres, even thousands out there. You just need to search for them,
				or even make your own unique custom project that no one else has done!
