			<p class="about">As a requirement for the CoolTech Project, we had to chose a topic that can help society/the world in a positive way. So, both of us thought that since
			the world is becoming more technology advanced as the years progress. Technology is becoming more advanced, this being Computers, AI, software and anything else
			just technolgoy related.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about">So, we chose a topic related to technology that will help the any kind of generation, which is helping people understand coding languages. This can 
			help the world due to the fact that almost everything is becoming digital and most of the time, in order to get into any kind of Technolgoy related job, 
			you need to learn how to code using one of the many coding languages that are available.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about">Our main objective with doing this project, is to teach people how to code. In order to do that, we have created something using a Raspberry Pi, 
			which is a single-board computer. This meaning, it is a very small version of one of the larger computers. Kind of like a phone version of a computer. You can 
			use basic computer science from schools, and create many kind of projects using a raspberry pi. You can use almost any kind of coding language. For our example,
			we are going to be using Python to move a small custom built RC buggy.</p>

			<p class="about">The premise of creating this RC Buggy using Python Code + A Rasbperry Pi is to show off what you can do with something as litle as a rasbperry pi. 
			There are so many unique kind of things you can create with just one rasbperry pi, let alone multiple connected.</p>
